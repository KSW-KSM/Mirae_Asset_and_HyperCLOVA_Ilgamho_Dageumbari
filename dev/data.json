      "text": "[By David Shepardson and Tim Hepher, WASHINGTON/PARIS (Reuters) -Boeing is in talks with the U.S. Defense Department over how the planemaker's planned guilty plea could affect its extensive government contracts, a person briefed on the matter said., On Sunday, the Justice Department said in a court filing that Boeing (NYSE:BA) had agreed to plead guilty to a criminal fraud conspiracy charge to resolve an investigation linked to two 737 MAX fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people., A guilty plea potentially threatens the company's ability to secure lucrative government contracts with the likes of the U.S Defense Department and NASA, although government agencies can waive any restrictions. Final details of the deal are expected to be filed by July 19., Pentagon spokesperson Air Force Major General Patrick Ryder told reporters the agency would make an assessment to decide the impact of the guilty plea on Boeing's contracts. He did not address whether the agency was in talks with the planemaker., \"DOD will assess the company's remediation plans and agreement with the Department of Justice to make a determination as to what steps are necessary and appropriate to protect the federal government,\" Ryder said, adding any actions would be under U.S. government contracting regulations., Boeing and the Justice Department had no immediate comment. NASA declined to comment., Boeing shares pared early gains and closed up 0.6%., Boeing's Defense and Space unit is vital to its business, with $7 billion in first-quarter sales, up 6% from a year ago., In its annual report, Boeing said U.S. government contracts represented 37% of last year's revenue including foreign military sales. A government report said Boeing had $14.8 billion in Pentagon contracts in 2022., The financial costs tied to the plea appear \"manageable relative to the companyâ€™s scale and overall obligations,\" said Ben Tsocanos, airlines director at S&P Global Ratings. , \"We expect that Boeing will likely continue to be a key supplier of defense and space products following the guilty plea,\" he added., The deal is also likely to be scrutinized outside the United States where Boeing is a key player on global markets, defense industry experts said., The Canadian government said it is \"awaiting a decision on these legal proceedings and will assess implications once confirmed\" and said the planned acquisition of the Poseidon P-8A is proceeding., All this comes at a time when geopolitical tensions are rising, pushing up defense spending., On paper, Boeing faces possible restrictions on future exports to a swathe of international markets, though whether it is actually excluded could depend on discretion allowed to local agencies and the realities of the defense market, they added., FOREIGN SALES, For example, Britain, which operates Boeing's P-8A maritime patrol plane, and the European Union both have rules barring contractors with definitive criminal convictions from bidding for public contracts across many sectors for certain periods., \"That is the letter of the law,\" said Keith Hayward, a fellow of the UK's Royal Aeronautical Society whose published research include works on localization in the defense industry., \"The worst case analysis is that they would simply be barred from bidding, but this is a highly political as much as a legally defined business,\" Hayward said., \"It depends how much the customer wants the product and whether Boeing control a particular product line - P-8 is a good example - where there aren't many alternatives.\", As part of the plea deal, Boeing will pay a criminal fine of $243.6 million, doubling an earlier agreement., Boeing has also agreed to invest at least $455 million over three years to strengthen safety and compliance programs and to have the Justice Department appoint an independent monitor to oversee compliance for three years., On Monday, the Justice Department opposed a bid by the families of those killed to force the government to immediately appoint a monitor that would oversee Boeing for five years., The DOJ said it generally takes \"a number of months\" to identify and vet candidates., Under Sunday's deal, Boeing is set to plead guilty to making knowingly false representations to the FAA about having expanded a key software feature used on the MAX to operate at low speeds that was tied to both fatal crashes., Family members intend to appear at a future hearing to object to the plea deal. Paul Cassell, an attorney for the families, described the proposed deal as the result of \"crafty lawyering between Boeing and DOJ\" and called for a public trial., In 2023, U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor, who will decide whether to accept the plea, leveled harsh criticism at Boeing, citing what he called \"egregious criminal conduct\". But he said he was limited in what actions he could take., , U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth said on Monday that despite the expected guilty plea, Congress \"must not let up on its own oversight of both Boeing and the FAA, and that is something I plan to continue to pursue.\", Boeingâ€™s bonds were trading higher Monday. Their credit spreads, or premium over risk-free bonds, were trading slightly tighter than their levels last week, according to data from BondCliq which tracks secondary trading of corporate bonds., , Don't miss out on the next big opportunity!

Investors were holding out for dovish cues from Powell after a swathe of recent readings showed some cooling in U.S. inflation and the labor market., U.S. consumer price index inflation data is also on tap this week. , Growing expectations of interest rate cuts by the Fed boosted Asian markets in recent sessions. Markets were seen pricing in a greater chance for a cut in September., The Nikkei 225 index was the best performer in Asia on Tuesday, rising over 1% to a record high of 41,421.50 points. The broader TOPIX index rose 0.4% and was in sight of a record high hit last week. , Technology stocks, especially chipmakers, were the biggest boost to the Nikkei, as they tracked gains in their U.S. peers on hype over artificial intelligence. Weakness in the yen, which was near a 38-year low, also boosted export stocks., Foreign buyers were a key driver of recent gains in Japanese markets, as a mix of yen weakness and a dovish outlook for the Bank of Japan drew in capital., Expectations of major corporate reforms in Japanese companies, which are expected to see them prioritize shareholder returns, also made local markets appear more attractive. , Still, doubts persisted over just how much higher Japanese stocks will push, given that the economy was struggling with weak consumption and sticky inflation. , Other Asian markets also rose. Gains in tech helped South Koreaâ€™s KOSPI add 0.4%, while Australiaâ€™s ASX 200 surged 0.7% as it rebounded from two days of losses.

      "text": "[By Dawn Chmielewski, (Reuters) -Skydance Media CEO David Ellison sketched out a vision on Monday for Paramount Global as a technology-media hybrid company at a time Hollywood has been competing for attention with tech giants moving into the entertainment business. , In an hour-long presentation to the financial community following the announcement of a merger agreement with Paramount, Ellison invoked Steve Jobs, describing the late Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) co-founder and Pixar Animation Studios leader as a mentor who informed Ellison's view of the relationship between art and technology., \"The art challenges the technology and the technology challenges the art,\" said Ellison, recalling a favorite Jobs quote. â€œWe believe that understanding of the symbiotic relationship between art and technology is essential to be able to meet this moment.â€, A \"key thesis\" behind the merger of Skydance, a media company launched in 2010 to capitalize on the rise of streaming media, with the century-old Paramount whose roots extend into the silent film era, is to position the company to better meet the demands of a changed market. Ellison discussed making changes to the Paramount+ streaming service and hinted at using artificial intelligence., â€œThere are a lot of technology companies that are rapidly expanding into media,â€ said Ellison. â€œWe believe it is essential for Paramount to be able to expand its technology prowess, to be both a media and technology enterprise.â€, Ellison told investors he would work to improve the algorithmic recommendation engines that Paramount+ uses, hoping subscribers will spend more time on the streaming service and that fewer will cancel. , He also proposed upgrading the advertising technology to give marketers more information about which audiences they reach. , A slide deck accompanying the investor call described how artificial intelligence would â€œturbocharge content creationâ€ and help drive â€œefficienciesâ€ and streamline operations., â€œOne of the things that people are underestimating\" about Ellison \"is his sense of tech, compared to some of the other guys â€¦ maybe with his fatherâ€™s help or just his upbringing,â€ Endeavor CEO Ari Emanuel said in an April interview with Reuters. Ellison's father is Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) co-founder Larry Ellison., PARTNERSHIP WITH ORACLE, Ellison's tech pedigree factored into the decision by Paramount controlling shareholder Shari Redstone to strike a deal with Skydance, a longtime production partner of Paramount, according to a source familiar with the discussions., \"Skydance is well aware of what we have accomplished over the years and it is for that reason that they have pursued a combination with Paramount,â€ Redstone wrote in a note, seen by Reuters, to Paramountâ€™s employees on Sunday night after the merger was announced., â€œThey have a clear strategic vision for the future and the resources to build on Paramount Globalâ€™s competitive advantages to drive the companyâ€™s success.\", Ellison described how Skydance worked in partnership with Oracle to create a cloud-based animation studio. Skydance used this â€œstudio in the cloudâ€ to produce part of â€œSpellbound,â€ an animated film scheduled to be released this fall on Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). He said the approach increased efficiency and reduced costs. , â€œWe intend to scale that business across all of our production workflows and animation,â€ said Ellison., Tech is also at the core of storytelling at Skydanceâ€™s two interactive games teams, a virtual reality development studio behind â€œThe Walking Dead: Saints and Sinnersâ€ and an interactive group partnered with Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) and Marvel to produce the forthcoming title, â€œMarvel 1943: Rise of Hydra.â€ , Ellison is using AI in a way that he described as â€œreally pushing the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible in game-play.\", , Jeff Shell (LON:SHEL), the former NBCUniversal chief executive who will join the newly merged company as president, told Reuters Ellison is well equipped to help navigate the entertainment industry's technological change, \"as somebody who writes scripts and is in table reads and was an actor at one point and also, by the way, can code.\", \"David is one of one,\" said Shell. \"And he's going to define ... the identity of new Paramount.\", , Feeling overwhelmed by investment information?

      "text": "[By Tom Hals, WILMINGTON, Delaware (Reuters) -A record $7 billion in attorneys' fees for three firms that successfully challenged Elon Musk's $56 billion Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) pay package provides an incentive for lawyers to hold corporate boards accountable, an attorney for a company shareholder told a Delaware judge on Monday., For more than six hours, legal teams for the company and a shareholder sparred over how much to award to three law firms which represented Richard Tornetta, who owned nine shares of Tesla when he sued over Musk's pay package in 2018., The fee Tornetta has asked for on behalf of the firms equals around $7.3 billion at Tesla's Monday stock price and amounts to a rate of roughly $370,000 for every hour worked by the 37 lawyers, associates and paralegals, court documents submitted by Tornetta's lawyers showed., John Reed, Tesla's lawyer, said on Monday that the fee petition never should have been filed., \"It looks like a real-life lawyer joke,\" he told Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick (NYSE:MKC) of the Court of Chancery., The legal fee represents a cut of the value that the plaintiff's lawyers say was created for Tesla by a Delaware judge's January ruling that rescinded Musk's $56-billion pay package., The firms that represented Tornetta include Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann., Tornetta's attorney Greg Varallo said the shareholder's legal team was seeking far less than the law allows, which is up to 33% of the benefit to Tesla from the lawsuit., He said the January ruling was the largest judgment ever by an American court, excluding punitive damages, and argued that Tornetta's lawyers should receive 11% of that judgment paid in the form of 29 million Tesla shares., Varallo argued that a large fee award would encourage shareholder attorneys to try to protect small investors., \"If Delaware continues to perceive value in policing bad behavior, then narrowing incentives would be a very bad idea,\" Varallo said., Reed countered that the January ruling destroyed value by sending Tesla's stock down as it created uncertainty about Musk's future at the company., He asked McCormick to award as little as $13.6 million as a fee., More than 8,000 Tesla stockholders have flooded the court with some 1,500 letters and objections over the fee, according to court documents., The request vastly outstrips the current record fee in shareholder litigation of $688 million in an Enron class action, according to Stanford Law School., The Musk case took a dramatic turn when Tesla shareholders in June voted to ratify Musk's pay, which Tesla has argued corrected the flaws in the 2018 process that McCormick identified in her ruling., The company argues that Musk's pay package has been restored and that Tornetta's legal victory has been transformed into a loss., , McCormick will hear arguments about the legal impact of the ratification vote in the coming weeks., McCormick may take weeks or months to rule on the legal fee.

The decision imperiled billions of dollars in funding that Purdue and the Sacklers had promised to pay toward addressing the harms of the deadly crisis., A court-appointed committee of Purdue creditors, which includes individuals harmed by the opioid crisis as well as insurers and companies with opioid claims, said in a Monday court filing in White Plains, New York that they need the ability to sue to ensure that the Sacklers are not \"allowed 'off the hook' for their grotesque misconduct in creating and fueling the opioid crisis.\", The committee said it intends to engage in mediation and settlement talks with Purdue and the Sacklers before pursuing litigation., A spokesperson for the Sackler family members said the committee's court filing was \"riddled with factual errors\" and \"contrary to the goal of working together towards a resolution that provides billions of dollars for communities and people in need.\" The family members have denied wrongdoing but previously expressed regret that OxyContin \"unexpectedly became part of an opioid crisis.\", The committee said it supported Purdue's previous bankruptcy settlement as the most efficient way to get money to the victims of the opioid crisis, but it believes that the legal claims against the Sacklers are worth more than the $6 billion that the family members agreed to pay., The committee asked U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane for \"derivative\" standing to pursue Purdue's own legal claims against the Sacklers., Purdue likely has the largest claims against the Sacklers, including claims that they drained over $11 billion from the company and that their conduct made Purdue liable for other lawsuits, according to the committee., The Sackler family members disputed the $11 billion figure on Monday, saying that half of the money they took from the company was used for tax payments., Purdue, which pleaded guilty to misbranding and fraud charges related to its marketing of OxyContin in 2007 and 2020, supported the committee's request, saying in a Monday court filing that the company is \"not the most appropriate entity to pursue litigation\" against the Sacklers., In exchange, Purdue insisted that the creditors' committee give mediation a chance before taking further action, and said it remains \"hopeful\" that a new deal can be reached without further litigation., , The company has spent nearly five years in bankruptcy, attempting to reach a comprehensive settlement of legal claims by state and local governments, family members of opioid overdose victims, and others who have sued or may sue in the future., Purdue is scheduled to appear in court on Tuesday for the first time since the Supreme Court's June 27 ruling., , , AI computing powers are changing the stock market.

June's inflation rate is expected to slow to 3.1% year-over-year, from 3.3% in May, and the core measure is estimated by economists to stay steady at 3.4%., The week will end with the kick-off of the second-quarter earnings season with reports from major U.S. banks Citigroup, JP Morgan and Well Fargo on Friday., \"Investors are positioning as they expect a continuation of this rally for the rest of the year,\" said Bruce Zaro, managing director at Granite Wealth Management in Plymouth, Massachusetts adding that investors are hoping for a dovish tone from Powell., Ross Mayfield, an investment strategy analyst at Baird, said investors also want to hear Powell acknowledge \"that the two-sided risks are more evenly balanced today, in particular, with respect to the labor market.\", Traders have increased bets that the Fed will first cut rates in September, according to CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) FedWatch tool, which shows a 73.6% probability for a September cut, up from 72.2% on Friday and 59.8% a week ago., On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 31.08 points, or 0.08%, to 39,344.79, the S&P 500 gained 5.66 points, or 0.10%, to 5,572.85, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 50.98 points, or 0.28%, to 18,403.74., For the benchmark S&P 500, the tiny gain marked its fourth record close in a row, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq's advance on Monday marked its fifth straight record close., After four closing records in a row, MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe was up 0.07% after hitting an intraday record earlier on Monday.

Jeff Shell (LON:SHEL), former chief executive of NBCUniversal, will be its new president., The goal is to position the \"new Paramount\" as a \"tech hybrid, able to transition to meet demands of the evolving marketplace,\" Ellison told financial analysts on Monday., The deal, announced late Sunday, ends an era for Shari Redstone, whose late father Sumner Redstone transformed the family's chain of drive-in movie theaters into a media empire that included Paramount Pictures, the CBS broadcast network and cable television networks Comedy Central, Nickelodeon and MTV., \"Given the changes in the industry, we want to fortify Paramount for the future, while ensuring that content remains king,\" Redstone, chair of Paramount and National Amusements, said in a statement, citing a phrase her father coined., The merger would combine Paramount, home of such classic films as \"Chinatown,\" \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" and \"Breakfast at Tiffany's,\" with its financial partner on several major recent films, including \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" \"Mission: Impossible-Dead Reckoning\" and \"Star Trek Into Darkness.\", Ahead of an investor presentation on Monday, Paramount disclosed in presentation slides that the deal will produce $2 billion in run-rate savings, half of it in the first year. Restructuring and integration costs will reach $1.6 billion, according to the slides. , Paramount's 2025 revenue will reach $32.6 billion on a pro forma basis and 2027 revenue is expected to rise 2% to $33.5 billion, according to the slides. , The deal also gives Paramount 45 days to find a better offer, leaving open the possibility of yet another plot twist in an already chaotic deal process. If Paramount receives another offer, which Skydance does not match, it would pay a $400 million break-up fee., PARAMOUNT'S PAIN, Ellison, son of Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) co-founder Larry Ellison, stands to lead a media company with a mountain of challenges navigating an entertainment business upended by the streaming video revolution. , Paramount has shed nearly $17 billion in value since late 2019, as its traditional television business has eroded faster than its Paramount+ streaming service could turn a profit. , Ellison pledged to bring \"best-in-class\" technology and modern infrastructure to Paramount+ and the free streaming service, Pluto TV, even as it enhanced Paramount's traditional television networks., The Paramount-Skydance deal came together after months of talks that appeared to have derailed when Redstone abruptly called off negotiations on June 11 amid disagreements over issues such as how to indemnify the controlling shareholder over potential shareholder lawsuits., Other prospective bidders for National Amusements emerged: independent Hollywood producer Steven Paul, Seagram heir Edgar Bronfman, who is backed by private equity firm Bain Capital, and IAC Chair Barry Diller., NEW DEAL, Skydance sweetened the Redstone family's payout for the sale of National Amusements to $1.75 billion, said one of the sources familiar with the deal terms. It also enhanced legal protections from possible shareholder lawsuits, clearing the way for a new agreement, the source said., Under terms of the agreement, Skydance will merge with Paramount in an all-stock transaction that values Skydance at $4.75 billion, creating a company with an enterprise value of $28 billion., Ellison and his financial backers, the Ellison family and RedBird Capital Partners, will pay $15 a share in cash or stock to Paramount's non-voting Class B shareholders, representing a 48% premium as of July 1, and $23 a share for Class A voting shares, or a 28% premium as of July 1., The companies declined on Monday to disclose how much more money Shari Redstone would be paid for her Paramount shares compared to other shareholders., Based on Skydance paying $2.4 billion for Redstone's National Amusements, the deal values the holding company at $37.79 per Paramount share, and the Redstone family stands to pocket $27.55 per Paramount share because of $650 million in net debt., , This does not strip out some of the other assets that National Amusements holds besides its Paramount stake, including movie theaters and real estate. The parties declined to provide sufficient information for a direct comparison with the $23 that Class A stockholders will receive for each share and the $15 Class B stockholders will receive for each share., Once the transaction closes, likely in the third quarter of 2025, Skydance's investor group will own 100% of the new Paramount's Class A voting shares and 69% of its outstanding B shares., , With valuations skyrocketing in 2024, many investors are uneasy putting more money into stocks.

      "text": "[By Shariq Khan and Nicole Jao, NEW YORK (Reuters) - A double whammy of record heat and hurricanes should test U.S. refiners' resilience in coming weeks, raising the risk of extremely volatile fuel prices in the middle of the peak travel season, analysts said., The Atlantic hurricane season from June through November is an annual threat for U.S. refineries. Half of the country's over 18-million-barrel-per-day refining capacity is located along the Gulf Coast, highly susceptible to tropical storms. The U.S. is the largest fuel market in the world., Refiners this year may have to brace for more storms than usual. Government forecasters expect up to seven major hurricanes in coming months, double the annual average of three major Atlantic hurricanes with wind speeds over 111 miles per hour., Citgo Petroleum Corp was cutting output at its 165,000 barrel-per-day Corpus Christi refinery on Saturday and plans to run the facility at minimum during Tropical Storm Beryl's passage over the Texas Coast, sources said., The largest ports in Texas also closed operations and vessel traffic in preparation for Beryl, which is expected to strengthen back to a hurricane before hitting the area early on Monday., The intensity and timing of Beryl, which at one point became the earliest Category 5 hurricane on record, signals an active and disruptive season ahead, said Neil Crosby, crude market analyst at Sparta Commodities., \"Hurricanes remain the biggest wild card for gasoline prices,\" said GasBuddy analyst Patrick De Haan. \"No better reminder of that than Beryl,\" he said., Evacuation orders ahead of storms can lift stockpiling and boost fuel demand, causing prices for gasoline, diesel and other refined products to move higher, De Haan said., If a major storm hits the Gulf Coast's refining system, it could remove as much as a million barrels a day of fuel supply and lead to extended outages or even permanent closures, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)., Hurricanes heading for the Gulf Coast could also knock out a similar amount of crude supply, with the offshore Gulf of Mexico region housing around 14% of U.S. crude output., In 2021, U.S. oil and gas companies suspended more than 1.7 million barrels oil output in the aftermath of Hurricane Ida., Outages of around 1.5 million bpd of crude production and refining capacity can cause gasoline prices to jump by 25 cents to 30 cents, according to EIA., WARMER TEMPS, In addition to hurricanes, refineries this year must contend with more problems related to scorching heat., The latest U.S. monthly temperature outlook foresees above average temperatures in large parts of the U.S. in July, typically the hottest month., Excessive temperatures have supersized effects on commodity supply chains, including oil and fuel, JPMorgan analysts wrote last month., Most refineries are designed to operate between 32 and 95 degrees Fahrenheit. Triple-digit temperatures could lead to equipment malfunctions and reduction in refining capacity., Extreme heat last year led to a 500,000 bpd reduction in Gulf Coast refined products output, the JPM analysts wrote., Similar effects are being felt this year. Unit upsets reported by Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) at its Wood River refinery in Illinois last month were likely due to heatwaves, according to Kloza and other industry experts., SILVER LINING, A robust maintenance season earlier this year allowed U.S. refineries to undertake major upgrades and perform detailed upkeep which had been repeatedly postponed due to surging post-pandemic demand and supply disruptions., That should, in theory, make refineries better prepared for the hurricane season, said Alex Hodes, oil analyst at brokerage StoneX., Slow demand in recent months has also helped refineries build fuel stockpiles, which should act as a buffer in case of outages., U.S. gasoline inventories have risen by about 4 million barrels since the beginning of April to near 231.7 million barrels by June 28, in line with the seasonal average of the past five years excluding 2020., , Inventories of distillates including diesel and heating oil have grown by 3.7 million barrels from the start of April and were at 119.7 million barrels by June 28, slightly below the historical average excluding 2020, when inventories were sharply elevated by COVID-related demand destruction., \"There's not much margin for error,\" said Tom Kloza, head of energy analysis at Oil Price Information Service. \"I'm waiting to see what happens.\", , , With valuations skyrocketing in 2024, many investors are uneasy putting more money into stocks.
